		Essential to almost all recovery treatments, honesty, first and foremost is the aim. To admit you do have a problem. If you don't think you do, you don't. Check the stats page on the <a href="Cdata.html">Big Three</a> and ask yourself. <br>

		<h1>Low Self-esteem</h1>
		"...those suffering with
        low self-esteem are at a higher risk for drug and
        alcohol abuse, and tobacco use (Crump et al., 1997;
        Jones and Heaven, 1998)<br>
	
		"Self-esteem is associated with a broad range of
        mental disorders and social problems, both
        internalizing problems (e.g. depression, suicidal
        tendencies, eating disorders and anxiety) and
        externalizing problems (e.g. violence and substance abuse"(Mann et al, 2004)

		Long after he co-founded Alcoholics Anonymous, and many years into his sobriety even Bill Wilson would come to realize although his mystical leap of faith had saved him, it only temporarily covered deep psychological vaunerabilites that had never been addressed. In a<a href="https://barricks.com/AASayings/emotional.html"> letter </a> to a friend and in desperation to help, he would honestly reveal his unhealthy dependencies:
		<br>       
		"...Suddenly, I realized what the matter was. My basic flaw had always been dependence, almost absolute dependence, on people or circumstances to supply me with prestige, security, and the like. Failing to get these things according to my perfectionist dreams and specifications, I had fought for them. And when defeat came, so did my depression."<br>
